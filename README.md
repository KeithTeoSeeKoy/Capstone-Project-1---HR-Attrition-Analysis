# Capstone Project 1 - HR Attrition Analysis
This is an individual project done over 5 days. I've downloaded the IBM Watson dataset from Kaggle, clean it up and did some transformation via Power Query. I've found that the dataset has quite a worrying 20% employee attrition. This will impact the company talent retention as most of the employee who left are the younger ones. On top of that, the company has already been giving the employees quite an attractive salary with a good salary hike. The root of the cause from the analysis points toward the Overtime factor. About half of the employees who work Overtime left the company. Therefore, the company has to take a closer look at this situation.

I also did a Logistic Regression prediction model using Excel Solver. I've used a 80-20 train test split to generate up my model. With the trained Logistic Regression coefficient, I can then used it to predict whether an employee will stay/leave the company based on the latter profile.
